This guide describes how to install Plyvel.


Install Plyvel
==============

The recommended (and easiest) way to install Plyvel is to install it into a
virtual environment (*virtualenv*) using ``pip``, which will automatically grab
the latest release from the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/>`_
(PyPI)::

   $ virtualenv envname

   $ source envname/bin/activate

   (envname) $ pip install plyvel

For the more traditionally minded, downloading a source tarball, unpacking it
and installing it manually with ``python setup.py install`` will also work.

.. note::

   In order to succesfully build Plyvel, you will need to have a usable LevelDB
   library installed on your system.


Verify the installation
=======================

After installation, this command should not give any output::

   (envname) $ python -c 'import plyvel'

If you see an ``ImportError`` complaining about undefined symbols, e.g.

.. code-block:: text

   ImportError: ./plyvel.so: undefined symbol: _ZN7leveldb10WriteBatch5ClearEv

â€¦then the installer (actually, the linker) could not find the LevelDB library on
your system when compiling Plyvel. Make sure you have a shared LevelDB library
installed where the compiler and linker can find them. For Debian or Ubuntu
something like ``apt-get install libleveldb1 libleveldb-dev`` should suffice,
but any other installation method should do as well. After installing the
LevelDB library, redo the installation or try ``pip install --reinstall
plyvel``.
