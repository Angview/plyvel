Required before this library is to be taken seriously:

* Seeking to (or before) specific keys in iterators
* Decent packaging/releasing (setup.py)
* Decide on a license
* Documentation

  * Installation instructions
  * Simple use

Lower priority tasks:

* Custom comparators (if desired at all)
* Wrap DB.GetApproximateSizes()
