====

Required before this library is to be taken seriously:

* Seeking to (or before) specific keys in iterators
* Decent packaging/releasing (setup.py)
* Decide on a license
* Documentation

  * Simple use

* Transaction-like behaviour for write batches

Lower priority tasks:

* Custom comparators (if desired at all)
* Wrap DB.GetApproximateSizes()
