Required before this library is to be taken seriously:

* Decent packaging/releasing (setup.py)
* Expand docstrings/API docs
* Transaction-like behaviour for write batches
* Handle Options args in repair_db() and destroy_db() (only those that make
  sense)

Lower priority tasks:

* Custom comparators (if desired at all)
* Wrap DB.GetApproximateSizes()
